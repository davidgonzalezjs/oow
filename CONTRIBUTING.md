Issues and Pull Requests are welcome. This project is particular because it does not stick to some JS conventions, but the purpose is not that, but having a consistent way of teaching OO in a more pure way. Changes aligned with this philosophy can be integrated.

If you add a new feature, please add a unit test for it on the `test/extensions` folder if it's an extension, or `test/objects` if it is a new object.

Using [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) is a nice-to have :)
