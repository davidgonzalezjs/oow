# Contributing

Issues and Pull Requests are welcome. This project is particular because it does not stick to some JS conventions, but the purpose is not that, but having a consistent way of teaching OO in a more pure way. Changes aligned with this philosophy can be integrated.

For any type of code change where behavior is affected (a new feature or a bug fix), please add a unit test for it on the `test/extensions` folder if it's an extension of an existing JS object, or `test/objects` if it about a new object.

For new features, please include a documentation in our README files.

Using [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) to format your commit messages s a nice-to have :)
